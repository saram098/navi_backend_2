I want to build a backend system for a clinic appointment and chatbot platform using FastAPI and MongoDB Atlas. It should be designed to work for both a WhatsApp chatbot (via Twilio) and a mobile app (in the future).

What the backend should support:
Authentication:

User registration and login with email and password.

OTP verification via email (simulate or mock for now).

JWT-based authentication.

Endpoints: /auth/register, /auth/login, /auth/verify, /auth/forgot-password, /auth/reset.

Physician Management:

Store and manage physician info (name, specialty, consultation price, and real-time schedule).

Data will be manually inserted for now, but should support future updates dynamically.

Endpoint to list physicians filtered by price, specialty, availability, etc.

Appointments:

Book appointments with physicians.

Each appointment includes: patient info, physician_id, date, time, and booking status.

Endpoint to get userâ€™s own bookings.

Payments:

Stripe integration for payment.

Endpoint to create Stripe payment intent and return client_secret.

Insurance Check:

Endpoint where user submits Emirates ID.

System will simulate a check by putting that ID into an external website (mock this for now).

WhatsApp Chatbot:

Built using Twilio API.

Users can interact via WhatsApp to get physician suggestions, check availability, book appointments, and submit Emirates ID for insurance check.

Chatbot should use OpenAI API to understand and handle dynamic queries using an agent framework.

OpenAI Integration:

Use OpenAI to help the chatbot understand natural language questions and route them to the correct endpoints or MongoDB collections.

Database:

Use MongoDB Atlas with collections:

users

physicians

appointments

clinic_info

medical_packages

Future collections may be added, so structure must be scalable.

Architecture:

Should be modular and production-ready.

Support both chatbot and app clients with the same API.

Project folders: endpoints/, models/, db/, utils/, settings/, agents/, services/.

Environment Variables:

Use .env to load config: MONGO_URI, SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, TWILIO_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, OPENAI_API_KEY.

Tech Stack:

FastAPI

MongoDB (with Motor)

Stripe

Twilio

OpenAI

JWT

Uvicorn

Build the backend with this complete setup and ready for real-time chatbot use on WhatsApp and future mobile app integration.
